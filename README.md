# HeadcountForecast (Take Home Project)

These files were used to forecast headcount requirements to meet forecasted revenue requirements, as well as apply statistical and data mining techniques to employee data in an effort to reduce employee turnover (and thus reduce forecasted hiring requirements).

The .ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook containing all of the python code used to import and manipulate data, make headcount forecasts, and run scikit-learn decision tree models.

The RStudio folder contains the R code used to generate Kaplan-Meier survival curves for Juniors vs. Seniors.
